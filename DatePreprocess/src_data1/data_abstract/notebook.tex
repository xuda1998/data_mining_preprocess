A little bit funky and unsettled when you pop the screwcap, but soon it finds its floral, blueberry base. Remains superficial and sweet in the mouth, with candied flavors, vanilla and mild oak. Highly regular; could use more concentration and density.                                                                                                                                                    6
Powerful in Zinny character, this blend of Dry Creek and Russian River grapes bursts with brawny flavors of wild berries, chocolate-covered mint, tobacco and pepper, wrapped into sturdy tannins. Shows real class and character.                                                                                                                                                                             6
92-94 Barrel sample. A rounded wine, its tannins submerged into the ripe fruits. It feels soft, and there is just a bite of alcohol. The structure is soft, generous, opulent.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 6
86-88 This could work as a rich wine, because there is good structure and piles of botrytis. It could be delicious, with its lovely dry finish, but that's for the future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     6
Gibilmoro, a pure expression of Nero d'Avola, sees some oak aging to shape aromas of toasted walnut, nutella and wood spice. In fact, not much of the natural fruit is left, and what is there feels jammy and ripe.                                                                                                                                                                                           5
Sweet cherry and baking vanilla aromas are followed by layers of plum, raspberry and spice in this kosher Bordeaux blend from Israel. The wine offers firm tannins and a lingering finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     5
The wine is redolent of bright blueberry and cherry with a tonic, youthful berry feel in the mouth. This easy blend of Cabernet Sauvignon (60\%), Syrah and Cabernet Franc would make the perfect companion to pizza or pasta.                                                                                                                                                                                  4
You would be hard-pressed to guess the varietal in a blind tasting—it's generic red, almost 15\% alcohol, cherry fruit, astringent tannins, some black olive and licorice. Quite drinkable but nondescript.                                                                                                                                                                                                     4
Opens with a load of sweet, candied black-fruit aromas but this wine excels on the nose because it's composed and precise for being so young and simple in scope. Velvety, rich black-cherry flavors run the show, and the finish brings length and an herbal shading. Very nice for a wine from Toro at this price.                                                                                           4
Straightforward, leesy, fresh, simple Pinot Blanc, with a mix of jicama, celery and yellow apple flavors. There's a bit of cinnamon spice in the finish; this is a good, everyday sipping wine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                4
Medium-bodied and supple in texture, this dark and brambly Virginian Merlot offers plenty of black fruit and warm, savory spices. Aged in a combination of American and Hungarian oak, there's a slightly reedy, wooden note and high-toned acidity on the finish.                                                                                                                                             4
Lots of jammy blackberry, blueberry and cherry fruit in this dry Merlot. It's a little rough in the mouth, with pronounced acidity and some green flavors. Drink now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4
With its definite spritz, this is light, just off-dry Vinho Verde. It has vibrant green fruits, although the yeast character is perhaps too dominant.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          4
Good flavors of citrus, peach, spice and toast in this classic blend of Chardonnay, Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier. It's dry, but rough in the mouth, with a scoury finish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      4
Yellow/gold, lightly honeyed, with a yeasty character. Peach pit and nectarine, with a finishing touch of Meyer lemon, add length and some complexity. Drink soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             4
This is an impressive, oak-aged expression of Vermentino in a world that usually sees this variety fermented in a simple, fresh manner. This wine has a bigger ideal in mind: To be an important Italian white and it achieves its objective beautifully. Pair it with lobster or white meat.                                                                                                                  4
A simple wine with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. There are plenty of bright fruit aromas to keep your interest. Try this wine with Margherita pizza or easy pasta with tomato sauce.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            4
A balanced Malbec with red fruit aromas and just a touch of aged cheese on the nose. The palate is creamy and slightly candied, with layered black fruit, fig and chocolate flavors. Creamy and candied but lively on the finish, with enough integrity and structure to rank as a Best Buy.                                                                                                                   4
This is all tannin, bitter chocolate and a dense texture. It seems to be drying out as the fruit goes, while there are few signs of softening. It suffers from the heat of 2003.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               4
A big, fruity bold wine, packed with the ripest fruit, concentrated and complex, with room for tight acidity. It has citrus and green plum crispness, and needs time to fully integrate with the wood and ripe yellow fruits.                                                                                                                                                                                  4
A tightly tannic wine, with a firm feeling of wood, balanced by stalky black currant fruit and a layer of acidity. It is still young, with the tannins likely to soften.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       4
A good Chardonnay, rich and creamy in pineapple, lime, Asian pear, vanilla and new oak flavors. It's balanced with crisp acidity. Drink now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4
Here's a fresh and cheerful Sangiovese-based wine that shows bright berry tones and soft spice nuances. It proves a very food-friendly wine that would pair with pasta, light meat dishes or rolled pork roast.                                                                                                                                                                                                4
Rich and full-bodied, this white has almond, peach and mango flavors. In the mouth, it feels rich and concentrated, the acidity slow to reveal itself.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         4
From vines planted in 1958 in an appellation that straddles both Sonoma and Mendocino counties, this is an intriguing, interesting wine, mostly varietal, with 8\% each of Mourvèdre and Syrah. Floral, it veers into leather and game, with a juicy backbone of red cherry and berry and earthy, textured tannins.                                                                                             4
Solid blackberry, black currant, bacon, black pepper and sandalwood flavors in this dry wine. The grapes come from a small appellation in Mendocino County. It's too soft, lacking structure, but has a certain opulence.                                                                                                                                                                                      4
Dry tannins dominate this rough-edged wine. There are plenty of bitter cherry and cocoa flavors, while the acidity gives an attractive freshness. Those tannins need a year to settle down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    4
Shows the rich fruit, acidity and silky texture of Calera's spot on Mount Harlan, with cherry, cola and sweet sandalwood flavors. It's not as complex or concentrated as the single-vineyard bottlings, but is a good approximation.                                                                                                                                                                           4
There are bitter tannins in this bone-dry wine. It's also thin in cherry and currant fruit. But it's clean, and at this price, a good, sound everyday sipper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  4
Attractive fruits with a good, juicy flavor characterize this easy, fresh wine. Black berry flavors and vivid acidity make it ready to drink now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              4
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ..
While light in color, this rich wine is full of both fruit and tannin. It has real Pinot Noir cherry and strawberry flavors, lightened by cool acidity. The structure comes from the rich wood flavors and the complex tannins. Drink from 2015.                                                                                                                                                               1
Dusty aromas blend with cool-climate notes of bell pepper and lime on this racy, green-leaning SB. Flavors of wet stones, lime and salt are crisp, while this finishes with a bell-pepper flavor and zesty acidity. This was made for raw oysters or ceviche.                                                                                                                                                  1
A beautiful, classy Pinot Noir that shows the varietal purity that always comes from this well-regarded vineyard. Dry and firm in acidity, it shows flavors of mashed red cherries, black raspberries and cola, with hints of orange peel, violets, anise and pepper. Best now and through 2012.                                                                                                               1
Creamy rose and peach puree notes create a very sensuous and seductive scent. The light-footed creaminess continues fluidly on the slender palate, helped along by a touch of flavor-boosting sweetness. But this is pervaded by freshness to finish off dry. Drink soon while flavors are at their peak.                                                                                                      1
A bit more easygoing than the PX wines of Jerez, as it delivers white raisin, milk chocolate and brown-sugar aromas and flavors. The palate is far from aggressive; in fact, it's a little low in acidity, which results in a soft mouthfeel and a short finish. Excellent stuff; just not a classic.                                                                                                          1
The acidity here is certainly the Chenin Blanc, but with the richness of Chardonnay in the mix, the wine has a full character, softly ripe, apples and pears dominant. It has a crisper feel at the end, bright and lively and ready to drink. Screwcap.                                                                                                                                                       1
Passerina is a little-known grape from central Italy that offers good structure and density in the mouth. It's not necessarily aromatic, but it does offer tones of almond skin, butterscotch and Golden Delicious apple.                                                                                                                                                                                      1
Ripe strawberry pie and cigar box aromas frame the nose on this top-end offering from Broken Earth. It's surprisingly light on the palate, with cherry pie and cranberry tartness leading the way alongside bright acidity and dainty tannins.                                                                                                                                                                 1
This is a plump, succulent and slightly sweet wine that is a pleasure to drink and pair with easy foods such as meatloaf or roast pork. This Dolcetto opens with a vibrant ruby color and pretty aromas of blueberry and cherry.                                                                                                                                                                               1
A powerful Pinot from a cool region. There's plenty of root beer, bacon, and cedar in the rustic, woody bouquet. And it will fill your mouth with cola, currants and black cherries, before leaving a thick and tasty residue on the back palate. A touch rambunctious and hot, so think about visiting it at this time next year.                                                                             1
Deep, a touch rugged, and lively, with berry aromas accented by strong whiffs of citrus peel, especially lemon rind. Flavors of black raspberry and cassis are convincing, while the palate is textured, with smooth tannins and integrated acids. Balanced overall; one of this winery's best offerings to date.                                                                                              1
Perfumed, floral wine, dominated by Moscatel grapes. The white fruits, pear and vivid acidity give the wine a fine, fruity balanced character.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1
Rubbery berry, tea, cool mint, herb and savory aromas amount to something a bit funky. This Syrah feels chewy and tannic. Herbal, savory, soupy flavors finish with an infusion of tea-like influences on closing plum and berry fruit notes.                                                                                                                                                                  1
Smoky, dark and alluring is how this modern-leaning Rioja starts out. The nose is meaty and ultraripe, but balanced. And so is the palate, which shows flavors of blackberry, cassis, tobacco, cola and coffee. The finish is cuddly and long, with a splinter of coconut and lots of spice. A “racimo” in Spanish is a bunch, so the name refers to the three or so grape bunches that each vine produces.    1
Opens with a strong aroma of smoked meat and bacon, not bad, but indicative of brettanomyces in the winery. In the mouth are flavors of red and black cherries, with a spicy edge of clove.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1
Unusual for Bordeaux, this chateau's plantings contain 20\% Malbec, imparting a strong blackberry character to the wine. There's smoky oak, too, and intriguing spice and juiciness on the finish. Imported by Bernard Magrez.                                                                                                                                                                                  1
Based on Tibouren, a red grape found in Provence, this is a perfumed wine that tastes of the regions herbs and lavender. Both warm and light, it has notes of spice, red plum and a delicate aftertaste.                                                                                                                                                                                                       1
Likeable for its gentle, easy texture, silky tannins and ripely pleasant flavors of cola, cherries, coffee, spices and smoky oak. Almost the perfect restaurant by the glass wine, tasty and versatile.                                                                                                                                                                                                        1
Elegant, savory and balanced, this opens with delicate orchard fruit, Mediterranean scrub and wet stone scents. The vibrant, ethereal palate delivers lemon, nectarine and pear fruit, buttressed by crisp acidity. A savory mineral note gives it a mouthwatering finish.                                                                                                                                     1
High alcohol is giving this 100\% Cabernet some inherent instability that warrants against extended aging. However, if you drink it soon, you'll find a vastly rich, opulent wine, with blackberry jam, mocha and toasty oak flavors whose tannins reflect Napa's best. A fabulous steak, perfectly charred and prepared, will make you drain the bottle.                                                       1
Here's a pretty Chianti from the Senesi hills, made in an easy-drinking style, with delicate floral aromas and a bright palate of cherry and strawberry. This should be enjoyed young and would pair beautifully with pastas and grilled chicken.                                                                                                                                                              1
A 100\%-organic Chardonnay, stainless steel fermented and poured into a handy-dandy, also certified-organic AstraPouch (1.5 liter). This easy-to-bring-on-a-picnic wine is clean, balanced and simply drinkable with a note of sweet grapefruit and pineapple.                                                                                                                                                  1
This wine is as lush as apricots, pineapples and peach juice, but with refreshing acidity. Ample honey and buttered-toast notes from oak give it warmth. It's a very good Chard for drinking now with rich shellfish dishes, or a buttery wild mushroom risotto.                                                                                                                                               1
Ground pepper, tilled earth and black-skinned berry aromas all come together on this generous, full-bodied red. The fresh, delicious palate doles out ripe black cherry, black currant, licorice and clove alongside vibrant acidity and polished, fine-grained tannins.                                                                                                                                       1
With really ripe fruit and juicy black flavors, this is a rounded, warm wine. It tastes of sun, although there is also something more seriously structured about it. Acidity gives freshness, while the tannic structure suggests further aging. Drink now, but better in 2015.                                                                                                                                1
A bit tough and tannic, but noble enough in structure, this Mendocino mountain Syrah has bold plum, blackberry, mocha and herb flavors, and is very dry. It scores high on the deliciousness factor, and is at its best now and for a year or two.                                                                                                                                                             1
This luxury cuvée rides close to the edge of being too ripe for its own good. It's full bodied and rich, boasting flavors of prune, chocolate and espresso framed by hints of toast and vanilla. The texture is supple, turning velvety on the finish, which makes it accessible now. Drink it over the next few years.                                                                                        1
Ample black fruit along with mint and herbs make for a solid if unusual bouquet. It's fairly ripe and sweet to the taste, with bold cherry and raspberry flavors. Textured on the finish, with zest. The only negative is that it's rowdy and unrefined, but hey, that's rosso piceno. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.                                                                                           1
A beautiful Cab, soft and luscious, with nuances that keep you coming back. Blackcurrant, cassis, coffee, green olive and smoky oak flavors are wrapped in easy tannins that finish smooth and gentle. Delicious. Drink now.                                                                                                                                                                                   1
While the aromas are tight and firm, once it is in the mouth, this wine just explodes. The tannins are dark, almost impenetrable, dry and dense. These tannins are a layer over the fruit that just piles up with ripe blackberry juice, an edge of blueberry. The soft sweetness of this range of flavors continues on the finish, pitted against the tannins.                                                1
