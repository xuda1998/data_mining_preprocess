      "This luxury cuvée rides close to the edge of being too ripe for its own good. It's full bodied and rich, boasting flavors of prune, chocolate and espresso framed by hints of toast and vanilla. The texture is supple, turning velvety on the finish, which makes it accessible now. Drink it over the next few years.                                                                                        1\n",
      "Ample black fruit along with mint and herbs make for a solid if unusual bouquet. It's fairly ripe and sweet to the taste, with bold cherry and raspberry flavors. Textured on the finish, with zest. The only negative is that it's rowdy and unrefined, but hey, that's rosso piceno. Imported by Empson (USA) Ltd.                                                                                           1\n",
      "A beautiful Cab, soft and luscious, with nuances that keep you coming back. Blackcurrant, cassis, coffee, green olive and smoky oak flavors are wrapped in easy tannins that finish smooth and gentle. Delicious.

      "While the aromas are tight and firm, once it is in the mouth, this wine just explodes. The tannins are dark, almost impenetrable, dry and dense. These tannins are a layer over the fruit that just piles up with ripe blackberry juice, an edge of blueberry. The soft sweetness of this range of flavors continues on the finish, pitted against the tannins.                                                1\n",
